This is the repository for the website of the Dresden JavaScript MeetUp mysteriously called [DresdenJS](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/DresdenJS-io-JavaScript-User-Group/). The main website is [http://dresdenjs.io](http://dresdenjs.io).

It gets automatically deployed via GitHub pages - for that to work you *must* commit to *main*! If you want to fix/edit something on it - or a presenter yourself; send in a PR (against *main*) and we might reward you with collaborator access. From cats for cats. We are made by the people!

## Build & development

Made with [Astro](https://github.com/withastro/astro), check it out for the requirements (node version etc.)

Run (good-olde) `npm run build` for building and `npm run dev` for the development environment.

## Get involved!
