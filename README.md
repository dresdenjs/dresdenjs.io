This is the repository for the website of the Dresden JavaScript MeetUp mysteriously called [DresdenJS](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/DresdenJS-io-JavaScript-User-Group/). The main website is [http://dresdenjs.io](http://dresdenjs.io)](http://dresdenjs.io) (we are looking for a sponsor or better some clever human to incorporate lets-encrypt-magic for a proper SSL certificate).

It gets automatically deployed via GitHub pages - for that to work you *must* commit to *main*! If you want to fix/edit something on it - or a presenter yourself; send in a PR (against *main*) and we might reward you with collaborator access. From cats for cats. We are made by the people!

## Build & development

Made with [Astro](https://github.com/withastro/astro), check it out for the requirements (node version etc.)

Run (good-olde) `npm run build` for building and `npm run dev` for the development environment.

## Get involved!
If you have any ideas for DresdenJS, don't hesitate to contact us at [info@dresdenjs.io](info@dresdenjs.io)

## Sponsors
Currently, we have no real sponsors - and the sloths @[Zalari](https://github.com/zalari) are too busy coming up with a nice logo...

 // TODO: add super-fancy LOGO here for Zalari
